# 🌟 T.A.R.A. – Teen Academic Risk Analyzer

T.A.R.A. (Teen Academic Risk Analyzer) is a machine learning–powered tool designed to predict academic stress levels in school students based on their daily lifestyle habits. Built as part of a Class 12 CBSE research project, this model transforms simple inputs like sleep, screen time, and study hours into powerful insights to support mental wellness in Indian teens.

## 📊 What T.A.R.A. Does

- Predicts a **stress score** (0–100) using lifestyle data
- Classifies stress level: **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High**
- Trained on a statistically balanced, synthetic dataset of 99 real students
- Explains predictions using a Decision Tree model
- Enables **manual inputs** to test individual students' stress profiles

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Built in **Python** using `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`
- ✅ Fully compatible with **Google Colab**
- ✅ Uses **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Trees**
- ✅ Interactive manual input section
- ✅ Visualizations: feature importance, decision tree structure

## 🧠 How It Works

T.A.R.A. analyzes 5 lifestyle variables:
- 💤 Sleep Hours
- 📚 Study Hours
- 📱 Screen Time
- 🏃 Physical Activity
- 👫 Social Interaction

It then:
- Calculates a **stress score**
- Categorizes it into:  
  `Low` (0–33), `Moderate` (34–66), `High` (67–100)

Models used:
- 🔹 `LinearRegression()` for score
- 🔹 `LogisticRegression()` for category
- 🔹 `DecisionTreeClassifier()` for explainability
